# TweedleDEE

TweedleDEE creates a Fermi background model generated from Fermi-LAT photon and spacecraft data in the form of a PMF file as well as a file containing the photon data from the ROI, both readable by MADHATv2. These files contain the background model for the ROI and photon data from the ROI, respectively.
